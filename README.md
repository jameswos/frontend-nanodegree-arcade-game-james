===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

Game instructions!
==================

Become a beautiful Princess by moving your character using the arrow keys on your keyboard to get to the river on they other side of the road! Sounds easy right?
Not exactly...
You will also need to dip, dodge, doop, davel and dodge your way around huge,
car-size beetles traveling at various speeds across the road! If a beetle gets
you, you'll become very cross and slightly furry, which will reset your position!

Have fun!
